This is a small project where I wanted to recreate the very famous game of the goose using HTML5, CSS and JS.

I have implemented special boxes, which keep a player still for one or two turns or allow him to re-roll the die.

The dice has a 3D animation, I took inspiration from several tutorials.

I hope you like it
